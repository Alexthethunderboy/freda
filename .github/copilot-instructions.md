This project is a production-ready, single-page birthday website for SIMISOLA FREDAMARY ADEWUNMI (Freda) built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. Prioritize accessibility, performance, and modular code. Use Lottie for vector animations, GSAP for timeline control, and canvas-confetti for confetti effects. All components should be functional, accessible, and mobile-first.
