Dear Freda,
It's funny that we've never met and it feel like I've known you for a long time, I want to you to know that it only gets better from here, progress and growth is inevitable.
Wishing you a wonderful birthday filled with joy, laughter, and love. You are truly special, and I hope this year brings you all the happiness you deserve.

With love,
Alex
